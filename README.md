## Project overview

This project consists of three practicals that demonstrate the transition from Java to Scala, focusing on functional programming concepts.

- **Practical 1**: The initial implementation of the project was done in Java. This practical covers the basic functionality and serves as the foundation for further development.
- **Practical 2**: The same code from Practical 1 was re-implemented in Scala, emphasizing functional programming techniques.
- **Practical 3**: This practical delves deeper into functional programming concepts, enhancing the Scala implementation with advanced functional techniques such as higher-order functions and tail recursion.

## Technologies used

- **Java**: Used in Practical 1 for the initial implementation.
- **Scala**: Used in Practical 2 and Practical 3 for functional programming, including higher-order functions and tail recursion.
